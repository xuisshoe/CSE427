The homework three is much more involving. The first problem involved the work I did during lab3, which is fun and helpful. The second problem involves a lot of reading which really help me understand the material better. The third problem not only involves the in-class knowledge but also required some online research and reading, it is on the hard side, but I can still manage to finish the homework on time. Overall a really involving homework, not too easy to do but not hard to do either.
