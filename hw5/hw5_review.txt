The homework 5 is a bit more engaging. I this homework I learned more advanced skills, rather than simply average tasks. This is a hard homework, it involves a lot of thinks as well as a lot of researching. I feel like the course materials are sufficient in terms of the knowledge however I still need to research for code implementation. Overall speaking this is a hard homework but in a good way cause it provides a lot of practice which help me understand the material a lot deeper.
