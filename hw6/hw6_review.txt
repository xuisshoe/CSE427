This is a challegning homework. The content involves a lot of thinking and researching. The lab5 is particularly hard, and its extensions which is the hw6 is even harder. I did a lot of research on how to handle this homework and did not succeed until really late. This is defiantly the most challenging homework so far. I definitely learned quite a lot by doing this homework. I had a wisdom teeth surgery this week which delayed my process and schedule by two days, which make things even harder for me to do. But I finished it on time anyway. Overall speaking a really hard homework.
