This homework is not that difficult. The first and last problem is a little bit tedious, but I can still manage to do it. It also helps me understand the materials a little bit better. The second problem is a little bit of challenging, it involves a lot of thinking and a better understanding of probability. I overall rate this homework as a easy homework and I can finish it on time with no pressure.
