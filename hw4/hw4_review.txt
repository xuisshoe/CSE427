Homework 4 Is much more harder than the previous works. It involves more coding and a requires a deep understanding of the concept. In addition, in order to finish the work, I need to do my own research on what command to use and what function to use, this is also a good experience since learning should always involves researching, in addition it also expands my own knowledge in JAVA and data management. Overall speaking this is a hard homework, it involves a lot of researching and self learning, the code itself was not hard  to think but I do need to look up and learn a lot of the commands and structure.
